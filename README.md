**School Projects Repository**
_______________________________

This repository contains samples of projects and assignments completed during my graduate program with the University of Denver. It includes projects completed independently and with teams. A brief description of the project(s) in each class folder is provided below. 

**Advanced Probability and Statistics**

_Insomnia in Students mlr_

  The focus of this project was to develop a teaching presentation for the class covering a statistical method that had not been covered in the class. My group was assigned multinomial logisitc regression and we chose to use an insomnia study of students as our dataset.

**Data Science Capstone**
  
_CNN Hyperparameter Exploration_

For this project the goal was to complete an academic analysis of hyperparameters of a convolutional neural network to understand their impact on prediction. To evaluate these hyperparameters, I built a neural network to classify images of handwritten characters with the appropriate letter.

_Fundraising Prediction_

The goal of this project was to identify whether a former charitable donor would be likley to donate again in an upcoming fundraising campaign. Multiple tree based classifiers were tested for this project. 

**Data Science Tools**

_Food Access and Graduation Rates Analysis_

This project focused on determining if there was a relationship between the level of food access and high school graduation rates by census tract. The assignment objective was to practice data cleaning skills and so the project focuses more heavily on teh data exploration and cleaning phase than the analysis portion.

**Deep Learning**

_Bird Species Identification_

This project focused on building a convolutional neural network to classify birds into the correct species based on their image. The assignment objective was to focus on understanding how to evaluate and optimize a neural network and so some common methods of improvement such as transfer learning were not explored. 

**Machine Learning**

_Bike Share Data Analysis_

This assignment used usage data from a bike sharing company and focused on data exploration, model selection, and model tuning. 

**Probability and Statistics**

_High School Graduation Rates_

This project used a decision tree regressor to predict high school graduation rates using various features from public school details
